Jerry Lewis was not a revered celebrity in France. He was renowned in French filmmakers' and critics' circles for the full control he exerted over his films and the unorthodox techniques he used in them, but this did not extend to the general public. Lewis was held in similarly high esteem among critics in much of continental Europe.
Jane Russell never wore a special bra designed by director Howard Hughes during filming of The Outlaw. She said the "ridiculous" contraption hurt so much "I never wore it in The Outlaw, and he never knew. He wasn't going to take my clothes off to check if I had it on. I just told him I did."
